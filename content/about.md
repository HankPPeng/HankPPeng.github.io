Welcome! You can call me:

**Weihong Peng** or **Hank Peng**.

Whatever you call, is me.

I am a M.E. candidate from [School of Electromechanical Engineering](http://jdgcxy.gdut.edu.cn/), 
[Guangdong University of Technology](http://www.gdut.edu.cn/), Guangzhou, China.

Also, I received B.D. in mechanical manufacturing and automation, 2014, from [China University of Petroleum](http://www.upc.edu.cn/), Qingdao, China.

You can find my CV here, [English version]() and [Chinese version](https://hankpeng.netlify.com/resources/resume_zh.pdf).

* I learned Matlab and Python to do my research, and I knew about R much.

* I've been using LATEX for 2 years, but I would combine LATEX with MS Word to write my thesis.
